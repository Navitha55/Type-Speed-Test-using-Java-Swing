# Type-Speed-Test-using-Java-Swing
A Java Swing-based Typing Speed Test project that helps users practice typing while measuring speed (WPM), accuracy, and completion time for each paragraph. Ideal for improving typing skills and real-time performance evaluation.

# Features
### ✅ Paragraph-by-Paragraph Typing
- Displays one paragraph at a time from a predefined document.
- Allows user to type the paragraph in a rich text input area.

### ✅ Real-Time Character Highlighting
- As you type:

  - Correct characters are highlighted in green.

  - Incorrect characters are highlighted in red.

  - Remaining characters are shown in default (black).

### ✅ Pause & Resume Functionality
- Use the Pause button to temporarily freeze typing.
- Resume the session anytime without losing progress.

### ✅ Restart Button
- Clears the input and resets timer for the current paragraph.

### ✅ WPM (Words Per Minute) Calculation
- Automatically calculates typing speed using:
- WPM = (Total characters / 5) / Minutes.

### ✅ Accuracy Calculation
- Measures how many characters were typed correctly:
- Accuracy = (Correct characters / Total typed characters) * 100.

### ✅ Per-Paragraph Result Summary
- On successful completion of each paragraph:

  - A popup summary displays:
      - ⏱ Time Taken (in seconds)
      - 📈 WPM (words per minute)
      - 🎯 Accuracy (%)

### ✅ Next Paragraph Button
- Becomes active only after completing the current paragraph.
- Loads the next line or paragraph from a loaded document or list.

### ✅ Final Result Summary
- After completing all paragraphs, shows:

  - 🧮 Total Time

  - ⌨️ Average WPM

  - 🎯 Average Accuracy
