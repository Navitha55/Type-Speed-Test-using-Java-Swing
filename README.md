# Type-Speed-Test-using-Java-Swing
Java Swing-based typing test tool that lets users practice typing paragraph by paragraph with real-time feedback. It highlights correct and incorrect characters instantly, calculates WPM, accuracy, and time taken for each line. Users can pause/resume, restart, and navigate through paragraphs using the Next button. After each line, a summary popup shows performance stats, and a final report is displayed at the end. Perfect for improving typing speed with precision!
